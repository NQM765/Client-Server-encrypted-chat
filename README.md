# Encrypted Chat Application using Python Sockets and RSA

## Overview

This project is a simple client-server chat application developed in Python. It utilizes sockets for communication and implements RSA encryption to secure messages. The messages are encrypted before being sent and are decrypted upon receipt, ensuring secure communication between the client and server.

## Features

- **Client-Server Architecture**: The application follows a basic client-server model where multiple clients can connect to a server to exchange messages.
- **RSA Encryption**: Messages are encrypted using the RSA algorithm before being transmitted and decrypted on receipt to ensure privacy.
- **Python Sockets**: Utilizes Python's socket library for network communication between the client and server.
